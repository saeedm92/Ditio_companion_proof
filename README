Install Coq and OCaml.

Download CompCert 2.4 from http://compcert.inria.fr/ and unpack it here.
Rename its directory to compcert (or create a symlink).

In the compcert directory:

  ./configure ia32
  make
  make clightgen
  make documentation

Get back to the parent directory and run ./compile_ditio.  Ignore the warnings.

Run ./vtests/test_genasm.native and you should see some output.
Write it out to an assembly file to pass it to the query processor:
./vtests/test_genasm.native > camera_audit_backend.S
